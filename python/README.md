# SDFC (Statistical Distribution Fit with Covariates)


## Features
- python3 and R version
- Fit with (or without) covariates parametric laws (Normal, Exp, Gamma, GEV, GPD)
- MLE and Bayesian fit available for all laws
- Fit of non parametric distribution (QuantileRegression)
- Support for fit with fix parameters
- Support for user defined custom link function


## Python instruction

Requires:
- python3
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- numpy
- scipy
- pybind11

For python, just use the command:
```
python3 setup.py install
```

If the Eigen library is not found (needed for Quantile Regression), use:
```
python3 setup.py install eigen="path-to-eigen"
```


## Note for quantile regression

The quantile regression is solved with the Frish-Newton algorithm, written in c++,
depending of the Eigen c++ library. It is a re-written of the Fortran code of
Koenker, available in the R package [quantreg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantreg/index.html)
